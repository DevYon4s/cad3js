Context: The development environment is a standard React/Vite setup with Three.js already installed. The core task is to implement all four requirements into the existing file structure using plain Three.js.

Constraint: DO NOT use @react-three/fiber or @react-three/drei. Direct usage of THREE objects and managing the rendering loop via requestAnimationFrame within React hooks (useRef, useEffect) is mandatory.
